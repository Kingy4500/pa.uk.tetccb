Your aim is to better and kill the other commander's, you have a select arsenal at youre disposal to assist in this objective. Play harder, build faster. There is also a tech system in play. Teching works based on cost, you can build everything with your commander but you have little reserves and little income to start. Using youre uber cannon, building walls and basic turrets should be your early game go to, for more advanced structures you're best saving up untill you can afford them. Building Energy Generators, Metal Extractors and Storage will help with this. Structures are as follows - The Single Defense Turret is now a repair turret - mid cost, quite a high metal output so use wisely, Double laser is your basic defense turret now, low cost. Pelter - Lob - Holkins are you're artillery tiers, pelter launches walls that explode after a short time, to be used to stifle enemy movement, mid cost, lob launches energy projectiles, basic artillery, good range, around 3x cost of pelter, holkins, late game artillery, massive range, deals massive area damage, around 3x cost of lob. Catapult, has a rapid fire low damage laser weapon and substantial armour, absorbs massive amounts of damage and keep's your positions locked down. Mine's, deploys a wall when triggered, warning : can cause your enemy to become triggered.";
